# Snakemaze
Snakemaze is a game with 10 levels, each one more difficult than the last. Depending on what difficulty setting you play, the challenge will increase. You move with arrow keys / WASD, and can pause by pressing P. Beat level 10 on insane mode and I will give you a high five :)
# How I made it
This game is built using webpack so I can use modules that I have developed in the past to save time while developing. I tried using typescript for a bit, but it was too much work to make everything compatible so I reverted to normal javascript. The rendering library I use is PIXI.js.
# Progress
You can see what I currently have left to do under the issues tab. Feel free to submit your own ideas, or bugs that you may find while playing the game.
