# Snakemaze
Snakemaze is a game with 10 levels, each one more difficult than the last. Depending on what difficulty setting you play, the challenge will increase. You move with arrow keys / WASD, and can pause by pressing P. Beat level 10 on insane mode and I will give you a high five :)
# How I made it
This game is built using webpack so I can use modules that I have developed in the past to save time while developing. I tried using typescript for a bit, but it was too much work to make everything compatible so I reverted to normal javascript. The rendering library I use is PIXI.js.
# Progress
This project is finished, but if you find any glitches or have suggestions, please submit them under the [issues tab](https://github.com/luketrenaman/snakemaze/issues).
